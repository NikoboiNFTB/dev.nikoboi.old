# Clone all repos into a directory named after the username
#
# Here's how to setup efficiently for your own use (step-by-step):
#
# Step 1. Go to your repositories at https://github.com/$author?tab=repositories
#
# Step 2. Extract all links using the filter "https://github.com/$author/" using Link Gopher
#
# Step 3. Paste all the links anywhere using your favorite text editor. I like VSCodium for its seek and destroy functionality.
#         Step 1. Use VSCodium's "Ctrl + F" tool to search for "https://github.com/$author/"
#         Step 2. Hit enter until it's removed all the links, leaving only the repository name.
#
# Step 4. Copy the repository names and paste the under repos=(). Don't forget to change author="" to your GitHub username.
#
# Step 5. Run it. You will need to make it executable using `chmod +x clone.sh`.
